# assumes that the remote is named "origin", which is not true for

# Hacks: the oss-fuzz-base/base-clang image (and its derivatives) lack
# some of the binutils-compatible LLVM tools that a SOF/Zephyr build
# relies on (when set to build with clang instead of gcc, obviously).
# Rather than figure out how to install them or why they're missing,
# just symlink to the GNU tools already installed.

# This is the worst.  SOF builds with C++ support even though it won't
# call it (there are eternal components that use C++, but nothing
# in-tree that can be fuzzed here).  For obscure compatibility
# reasons, when using clang Zephyr will still do the final link using
# binutils, which will pull in libstdc++ and not libc++.  Also, SOF is
# a 32 bit fuzz binary (it's firmware for a 32 bit DSP, and no one has
# done the work to make the source base 64 bit clean).  The oss-fuzz
# runner image does not have a i386 libstdc++.so.6!  But, well, we
# don't actually need any symbols from it, so...
